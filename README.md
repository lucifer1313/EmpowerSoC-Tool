# EmpowerSoC-Tool ( Beta Version ) 
EmpowerSoC is an open-source EDA tool that can be used for power estimation of SoC. It has been developed alongside the existing QFlow open-source tool chain. The emerging trend in applications for the ever increasing functionality, performance and integration within SoC is leading to designs that dissipate power in huge amounts and hence it has become essential to keep an eye at the amount of power dissipation while designing a SoC. This makes the EmpowerSoC a useful tool for the researchers who wish to put forward new low power designs.

Highlights - 

1. It can be used by researchers to calculate the most important
aspect of designing a SoC â€“ Power Dissipation.
EmpowerSoC brings together the features of various open-source tools along with an
additional feature of estimating power dissipation. It saves a lot of effort and time and
its user-friendliness makes it an indispensable tool for the researchers.

2. Power estimation is done by extracting transistor level netlists of the building blocks on an automated basis.

3. In EmpowerSoC, the user has the flexibility to calculate both active and standby
power dissipation. Standby power (leaking power) is the power which is dissipated
from the SoC while it is not active i.e. in sleep/standby mode. It is a major contributor
to power dissipation and becomes an essential design parameter while designing a
SoC. Active power, in contrast to Standby Power, is the power which is dissipated
while the SoC is active i.e. while performing a particular task.

4. EmpowerSoC comes with an intuitive and user-friendly GUI which is easy to use
and also allows the user to open multiple instances and show the results
simultaneously.

5. EmpowerSoC is backed by comprehensive documentation which is easy to
understand and self-explanatory. The Installation Procedure and Tutorials have been
presented in a lucid manner and guides the users how to start using the tool.
